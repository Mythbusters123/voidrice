# Myth's Fork of the VoidRice

## What differs from Luke's version?
1. Different Wallpapers -- because I'm a Ford Mustang nerd
2. LGPL -- Because I use non-free software sometimes (sadly)
3. Custom additions to vim configuration
4. Different cursors cause Adwatia is kinda ugly
5. More aliases, and more rust programs (zoxide, etc)
6. Different fonts
7. Ungoogled-Chromium instead of Brave-Bin
   
## So why not make your own dotfiles
Im lazy.
